# Stock Trading Simulator

A React-based stock trading simulator built with Vite. This app simulates real stock trading by displaying dynamic intraday charts, live stock quotes (via the Finnhub API), and a portfolio tracker for executing buy/sell orders.

## Features

- **Dynamic Charts:** Intraday charts update every minute.
- **Portfolio Tracker:** Manage cash and stock holdings with real-time values.
- **Ticker Selector:** Switch between stocks (e.g., AAPL, GOOGL, AMZN, TSLA) for live data.
